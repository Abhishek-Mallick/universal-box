## Motivation

**Universal-Box** was created to simplify the project setup process by providing users with a diverse collection of pre-built templates. Our goal is to enable developers to quickly configure their projects and deploy them with just one click. Whether you're launching a new web application, API service, or any other type of project, Universal-Box is designed to save you hours of initial setup time.
